Stickinote Lets you turn you statuses, thoughts or any text from where ever who knows you have gotten from into cool look-a-like stickynote images that you can share to your friends, back in Twitter. A color picker that gives you a 1,000,000 choises in color customisation of the background, status/thought/text and mentions/hashtags. Also an additional feature of turning the rest part of your text from where you choose to begin with into a different color entirely.
